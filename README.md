# React-Django CRUD Application

This project is a full-stack web application that combines a Django backend with a React frontend to implement a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. The application serves as a simple example of how to integrate Django, a powerful backend framework, with React, a modern JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Key Features

- **Django Backend**: Provides a RESTful API using Django REST Framework for managing data. It handles the server-side logic, database interactions, and data validation.
- **React Frontend**: A responsive and dynamic single-page application (SPA) built with React, allowing users to interact with the CRUD operations in a user-friendly interface.
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can create, read, update, and delete records seamlessly from the frontend, with all actions reflected in the backend database.
- **Modular Code Structure**: The project is organized with clear separation of concerns, making it easy to maintain and extend.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: Backend framework for handling server-side logic and database management.
- **Django REST Framework**: Extends Django to create a robust RESTful API.
- **React**: Frontend library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Axios**: Used for making HTTP requests from the React frontend to the Django API.
- **SQLite**: Default database for development purposes (can be replaced with other databases like PostgreSQL).

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
